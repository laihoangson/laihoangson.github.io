As a young professional early in my career, I understand there’s still much to learn - and I’m fully committed to that journey. With a strong academic foundation in finance and current postgraduate study in Business Analytics at Monash University, I’m working hard every day to develop both my technical and professional skills. I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience in finance, insurance, and data analysis, and I’m eager to keep improving through real-world challenges. I may be at the beginning, but I bring energy, adaptability, and a serious willingness to grow into every opportunity.
